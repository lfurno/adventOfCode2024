# AdventOfCode2024
This repository contains my solutions for the first four days of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024). 
Each day has its own folder with:
- `main.cpp` — your C++ solution.
- `input.txt` — the puzzle input downloaded from the website.
- a .txt file including the full assignment.

## Prerequisites

- A C++20–compatible compiler (e.g., GCC 10+ or Clang 10+)

## Build & Run
For each day’s solution, do the following from the repository root (replace `DAY_FOLDER` with `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.):

1. **Compile**

   ```bash
   cd DAY_FOLDER
   g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o solution
   ```

2. **Run**

   ```bash
   ./solution input.txt
   ```
The program will read the puzzle input from `input.txt` and print the results for that day’s parts.
